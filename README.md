# 30 Days of Learning C - Advanced Challenge

## Objective

This repository documents my progress in a **30-Day Challenge** aimed at learning as much as possible about the **C programming language**. Throughout these 30 days, the goal is to:
- Gain a deep understanding of the language's core features.
- Develop a solid foundation in memory management and low-level programming.
- Master data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques in C.

## Structure

Each day will build on the previous one, increasing the complexity of tasks and topics. By the end of the challenge, I aim to tackle advanced concepts such as systems programming, concurrency, and performance tuning.

### ðŸ“… **Daily Progress**

- **Days 1 to 5**: Core Syntax & Foundation  
  - Basic data types, operators, conditionals, loops.
  - Write simple programs with input/output operations.
  - Introduction to pointers and memory addresses.

- **Days 6 to 10**: Functions, Arrays, and Pointers  
  - Master function declarations, definitions, and the call stack.
  - Deep dive into pointers and pointer arithmetic.
  - Array manipulation with pointers, and an introduction to dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free`.

- **Days 11 to 15**: Memory Management & Data Structures  
  - Explore memory allocation, deallocation, and memory leaks.
  - Implement basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues) using pointers.
  - Master struct declarations and the use of typedef to simplify complex types.

- **Days 16 to 20**: Advanced Pointers & Algorithms  
  - Pointer-to-pointer concepts, double pointers, and function pointers.
  - Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, quicksort) and searching algorithms (binary search).
  - Understand recursion and implement recursive algorithms for factorial, Fibonacci, etc.

- **Days 21 to 25**: Modular Programming & File I/O  
  - Break programs into multiple files (header files and implementation files).
  - Efficient memory usage with realloc, calloc.
  - Work with file I/O: open, read, write, and close files using `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, and `fclose`.

- **Days 26 to 30**: Systems Programming & Optimization  
  - Delve into bit manipulation, bitwise operators, and their use in optimizing programs.
  - Learn about process control, system calls, and inter-process communication.
  - Study concurrency: implement multi-threading using POSIX threads (pthreads).
  - End with performance tuning and profiling using tools like `gprof` or `valgrind`.
